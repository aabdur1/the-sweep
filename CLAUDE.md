## What this is

**The Sweep** — a Chicago street-sweeping schedule lookup tool. Type an address (or use GPS), get your ward + section, see every sweep date for the season, download to your calendar.

The motivating problem: the city's official lookup is a clunky multi-click flow through PDFs and ward maps. People forget to move their cars and get $60 tickets. This app collapses it to one screen.

**Live at:** `<TBD — Netlify subdomain>`
**Owner:** Amir (Chicago)

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build | **Vite** | Fast HMR, minimal config |
| Framework | **React 18 + TypeScript** | Type safety on the data shapes is worth it |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first matches the editorial design system |
| Icons | **lucide-react** | Already aesthetic-aligned |
| Hosting | **Netlify** | Static site, no backend needed |
| State | **useState / useMemo** | App is too small for Redux/Zustand |
| PWA | **vite-plugin-pwa** (recommended) | "Add to home screen" is the killer feature for the use case |

**No backend.** All data sources have CORS enabled. Don't add a server unless we add features that genuinely need one (push notifications, multi-user accounts).

**No client-side routing** for now. Single page. Add `react-router` only if we add real subpages (e.g. `/about`, `/ward/25`).

## Architecture

```
User input (address or GPS)
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  geocode()       │  Census Geocoder → Nominatim fallback
│  src/lib/geocode │
└──────────────────┘
        │  { lat, lon }
        ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  lookupZone()    │  Spatial intersects query against
│  src/lib/zones   │  Chicago Data Portal polygon dataset
└──────────────────┘
        │  { ward, section }
        ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  fetchSchedule() │  Filtered query against schedule dataset
│  src/lib/sched.. │  Returns sorted Date[] for the season
└──────────────────┘
        │  SweepDate[]
        ▼
    UI renders: NextSweepHero + ScheduleAlmanac
```

Each layer is independent. If geocoding breaks, we still want zone lookup to work for the GPS path. If the 2026 zones dataset breaks, we want a 2025 fallback. **Always design data calls with a fallback chain.**

---

## Data sources (memorize these)

### 1. Schedule dataset

- **Resource ID:** `u5ai-3efk`
- **Endpoint:** `https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/u5ai-3efk.json`
- **Filter by ward + section:** `?ward=25&section=04`
- **Schema:**
  ```ts
  {
    ward_section_concatenated: string;  // "2504"
    ward: string;                        // "25" (note: zero-padded for some, not others)
    section: string;                     // "04"
    month_name: string;                  // "JULY"
    month_number: string;                // "7" (NOT zero-padded)
    dates: string;                       // "21,22" — comma-separated days of month
  }
  ```
- **Critical quirk:** `dates` is **two consecutive dates**, one for each side of the street. The dataset never tells you which side is A or B — that's only knowable from the orange temporary signs posted on the street. UI must show both dates and explain this.
- **Year:** Dataset rolls over annually. The resource ID changes each year. Currently `u5ai-3efk` for 2026; update `SCHEDULE_DATASET_ID` constant when 2027 drops.

### 2. Zones dataset (polygon boundaries)

- **2026 ID:** `2r7q-emq3`
- **2025 fallback ID:** `utb4-q645`
- **Endpoint:** `https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/{id}.json`
- **Spatial query:**
  ```
  ?$where=intersects(the_geom,'POINT(<lon> <lat>)')&$limit=1
  ```
- **Critical quirk:** The 2026 zones dataset was **delayed at season start** (March 2026). Always try 2026 first, fall back to 2025 if empty. The boundaries are nearly identical year-to-year so this is safe.
- **Returns:** `{ ward, section, the_geom: { type: "MultiPolygon", coordinates: [...] } }`

### 3. Geocoders (multi-provider chain)

**Order matters.** We learned this the hard way:

1. **U.S. Census Geocoder** (primary)
   - `https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/onelineaddress?address=<...>&benchmark=Public_AR_Current&format=json`
   - Free, government-run, no rate limits, designed for U.S. addresses
   - Coords at `result.addressMatches[0].coordinates.{x,y}` (x=lon, y=lat)
2. **Nominatim** (fallback)
   - `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=<...>`
   - Free but rate-limited and **frequently blocks sandboxed iframes**
   - Use only when Census misses

**Never default to a single geocoder.** If you add a third (Mapbox, Google), require an env var for the key and put it last in the chain.

### 4. Address cleaning

Geocoders choke on apartment numbers, ZIP codes, and duplicated city/state. Always run input through `cleanAddress()`:

- Strip `apt|apartment|unit|suite|ste|#|floor|fl|rm|room|bldg <token>`
- Strip 5- and 9-digit ZIPs
- Strip trailing `, Chicago, IL` (we re-append it ourselves)
- Collapse whitespace and stray commas

Test case that broke v1: `"1819 S. California Ave, APT BST, Chicago, IL 60608"`. Always test against this when touching the cleaner.

## Design system

This is **not** a generic SaaS app. The aesthetic is **editorial / civic almanac** — like a printed Chicago Department of Streets bulletin from a parallel universe where civic publications were beautiful. Lean into it.

### Tokens (CSS vars, defined in `src/index.css`)

```css
--cream: #F1E9D2;       /* Background — warm parchment */
--cream-dark: #E8DFC4;
--ink: #0F1A2E;         /* Primary text — deep navy */
--ink-soft: #1A2540;
--red: #B23838;         /* Chicago flag red — accents, urgency */
--red-deep: #8A2828;
--green: #2A4F3A;       /* Calm/safe state — bottle green */
--rule: #1A2540;        /* Borders */
```

### Typography

- **Display:** `DM Serif Display` — used for the masthead, dates, headlines
- **Body:** `IBM Plex Sans` — UI text, paragraphs
- **Mono:** `IBM Plex Mono` — labels, metadata, "section i / ii / iii" markers

Never substitute Inter, Roboto, system-ui, Arial, or any other generic sans for the body font. The Plex family is non-negotiable to the design.

### Layout principles

- **Single column, max-width ~600px.** This is a mobile-first tool. People check it on their phone in the morning.
- **Heavy 2px borders + 1px rules.** Newspaper-grade structure.
- **Section markers** ("✦ Section I — Lookup", "✦ Section II — Your Next Sweep") frame each block like an almanac entry.
- **Decorative ornaments** (◢ ◣ ◥ ◤) at corners of major panels.
- **Chicago flag stripe** at the top: red, cream, red, cream, red.

### Color use

- **Cream** dominates as background.
- **Ink** for all text and borders by default.
- **Red** *only* for: urgency (sweep ≤ 2 days away), errors, accent labels, the flag stripe. Don't dilute it.
- **Green** for safe / completed / calm states (e.g. "season concluded").

### Don'ts

- No purple gradients
- No glassmorphism, neumorphism, or any other 2020s-era SaaS cliché
- No gradient text
- No emoji except the Chicago flag stars (✦) and sparing utility marks
- No `border-radius: 9999px` on buttons. Buttons are sharp rectangles.
- No drop shadows except subtle paper-on-paper for layering

```

**Pattern:** `src/lib` is pure functions, no React. `src/hooks` orchestrates. `src/components` renders. Don't put fetches inside components.

---

## Common commands

```bash
# Setup
npm install

# Dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Deploy to Netlify (if Netlify CLI installed)
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## Deployment

- Hosted on **Netlify**. Repo connected via Git, auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- `netlify.toml` configures build command (`npm run build`) and publish dir (`dist/`).
- No environment variables required for the base feature set — all APIs are public, no keys.
- If we add a paid geocoder later (Mapbox), set `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` in Netlify env settings.

---

## Common tasks

### Adding a new data source

1. Add an entry to this CLAUDE.md under **Data sources**.
2. Create a pure function in `src/lib/`.
3. Build a fallback chain — never depend on a single endpoint without a plan B.
4. Type the response shape in `src/types.ts`.

### Adding a new feature

1. Sketch the data flow first. Does it need new fetches? New state? New routes?
2. Pure logic → `src/lib`. Stateful orchestration → `src/hooks`. Pure rendering → `src/components`.
3. Match the existing aesthetic. New components follow the same border / typography / section-marker pattern.
4. Test with the canonical address: `1819 S California Ave` (Pilsen, Ward 25).

### Updating for next year

When the city publishes the 2027 datasets:
1. Find new resource IDs at `data.cityofchicago.org` (search "Street Sweeping Schedule 2027").
2. Update `SCHEDULE_DATASET_ID` and `ZONES_DATASET_ID` in `src/lib/`.
3. Move the prior year's IDs into the fallback slot.
4. Update `SCHEDULE_YEAR` constant.

## Known gotchas

- **Two-date pairs are sides, not the same date confirmed twice.** Never deduplicate consecutive dates. The schedule dataset's `dates: "21,22"` field literally means "side A on the 21st, side B on the 22nd."
- **Ward numbers are sometimes zero-padded, sometimes not.** Pad to 2 digits on display (`"25"` → `"25"`, `"5"` → `"05"`) for consistency, but the API accepts either. Test both.
- **`month_number` is a string, not a number, in the API response.** `parseInt()` it.
- **Spatial queries need lon/lat order, not lat/lon.** `POINT(<lon> <lat>)`. WKT convention. Mixing this up returns no results silently.
- **Nominatim returns "Load failed" with no body when blocked.** Catch the throw, don't try to parse. Move on to the next provider.
- **Dates from Socrata come in TZ-naive format.** Construct with `new Date(year, month-1, day)` (local time), not `new Date(isoString)` which can shift by a day.
- **The city does corrections mid-season.** Schedule data is occasionally amended. We always fetch fresh, never cache to localStorage. (Memoizing per-session is fine.)
- **Sweepers run ~9am–2pm weekdays, weather permitting.** "Weather permitting" means rain or snow can cancel a day. We can't predict this — show the scheduled date and the city posts orange signs the day before.

## What's next (roadmap)

Order of priority:

1. **PWA / Add to home screen** — the whole point is "I check this in the morning before work." Should feel like an app, not a website.
2. **Calendar push notifications** — currently we provide an `.ics` download which gets the user 90% there. Native push would close the loop.
3. **Save addresses** — most users have one home address. localStorage save + quick-tap recall.
4. **Multiple addresses** — work parking, partner's place, parents' house.
5. **Live sweeper tracker integration** — the city has a real-time fleet tracker (`https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/streets/iframe/sweeper_tracker.html`). Embed or scrape.
6. **311 reporting shortcut** — if there's debris that wasn't swept, file a 311 ticket from the app.
7. **Dark mode** — but the editorial aesthetic was designed light-first. Dark mode needs its own design pass, not just inverted colors.

## Things to never do

- **Never store user addresses on a server.** This is a privacy-sensitive city tool. Everything stays client-side.
- **Never add analytics that send addresses to a third party.** Aggregate-only metrics (page views, lookup count) are fine; address data is not.
- **Never silently cache schedule data across sessions.** The city issues corrections.
- **Never substitute the typography or color palette for "more accessible" generic options** without a design conversation. Contrast can be tuned within the palette; the palette itself is the project.
- **Never add a backend "just in case."** If a feature genuinely needs one, we discuss the architecture first. The current zero-server design is intentional.
